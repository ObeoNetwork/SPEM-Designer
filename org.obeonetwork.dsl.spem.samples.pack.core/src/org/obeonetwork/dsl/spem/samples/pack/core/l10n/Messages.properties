SpemVerdeSample_title = Verde (Validation-driven design for component-based architectures)
SpemVerdeSample_desc = This sample was developed in the context of the ITEA-Project VERDE.
<p>
The growing complexity of software intensive, real-time embedded systems combined with constant quality and time-tomarket constraints creates new challenges for engineering practices.
</p><p>
These systems are developed according to a traditional application of the verification-and-validation cycle, where V&V activities start only when implementation and integration is completed. Many major issues, often related to the architecture and introduced early in the process, are not found until integration and validation.
</p><p>
At this point, they are more difficult and more expensive to fix. While preserving the V&V cycle, VERDE is promoting a more iterative and incremental approach to software development that will be driven by the early V&V activities.
</p><p>
The two principal goals are to:
<ul>
<li>Develop a solution for iterative, incremental development and validation of RTES that integrates testing and analysis tools;</li>
<li>Foster the industrialisation of this solution through a close collaboration between technology providers and end users from different domains, specifically software radio, aerospace, railway and automotive.</li>
</ul>
